# ü§ñ AI Applicant Selector

**An AI-powered platform for smart applicant screening and ranking.**  
Built for the **PLP x LSETF Hackathon ‚Äì Nigeria Edition** under the theme:  
_‚ÄúBuilding Tech-Driven Solutions for Nigeria‚Äôs Growth.‚Äù_

---

## üöÄ Overview

AI Applicant Selector helps organizations like **LSETF** and **PLP** automatically analyze and rank applicants for programs or jobs using AI.  
It processes resumes, cover letters, and assessments to generate **data-driven shortlists** and **insights dashboards** ‚Äî helping teams make fairer, faster, and more objective selections.

## üß© Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **AI Resume Screening** | Extracts and scores candidate skills, experience, and education. |
| **Ranking Algorithm** | Produces a ranked shortlist using weighted criteria. |
| **Smart Uploads** | Accepts PDF, DOCX, or CSV data for bulk analysis. |
| **Insights Dashboard** | Displays top candidates, stats, and charts. |
| **Integration-Ready** | REST API endpoints ready for LSETF LMS linkage. |

---

## üß† AI Scoring Logic (Prototype)
Each applicant receives a composite score:

score = (skills_match * 0.4) + (experience * 0.3) + (education * 0.2) + (assessment * 0.1)

```yaml

The weights are configurable and can evolve into a full ML model later (e.g., fine-tuned embeddings for job-fit prediction).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```plaintext
Frontend (React + Tailwind)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Pages: Home, Upload, Dashboard
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Components: Nav, Hero, FeatureCard, CandidateCard, Footer
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Connects via Axios to...
     ‚Üì
Backend (FastAPI / Node.js)
‚îú‚îÄ /api/upload        ‚Üí Resume upload & parse
‚îú‚îÄ /api/applicants    ‚Üí Fetch ranked list
‚îú‚îÄ /api/lsetf-export  ‚Üí LMS integration endpoint
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> AI Engine (Python/TF or rule-based model)
      - Resume parsing
      - Feature extraction
      - Weighted scoring
      - Ranking logic
```
> The architecture is modular ‚Äî the scoring logic can easily evolve into a Machine Learning model integrated with FastAPI.

#üßë‚Äçüíª Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/japhar1/ai-applicant-selector.git
cd ai-applicant-selector
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. (Optional) Run backend API (FastAPI or Node):
```bash

#üîå Integration Readiness

The system outputs standardized JSON suitable for ingestion by LSETF‚Äôs LMS.

Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ada Obi",
    "email": "ada@sample.com",
    "score": 88,
    "skills": ["Data Analysis", "Python", "Excel"]
  }
]
```
This format enables easy synchronization into user profiles or dashboards within the LMS ecosystem.
